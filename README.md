# Configuration Options

Optional parameters includes

| Config Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dhtExec` | Full command including path to read dht22 sensor.  Not needed unless dht22 is installed in a location not on the path.  Defaults to dht22 ie "dhtExec": "/usr/local/bin/dht22" |
| `cputemp` | Full command including path to read cpu temp sensor.  Not needed unless cputemp is installed in a location not on the path.  Defaults to cputemp ie "cputemp": "/usr/local/bin/cputemp" |
| `gpio` | Gpio pin to read for dht22 sensor.  Defaults to 4 ie "gpio": "4" |
| `Refresh` | Frequency of data refresh. Defaults to 1 minute |
| `name` | descriptive name |
| `name_temperature` (optional)| descriptive name for the temperature sensor |
| `name_humidity` (optional)| descriptive name for the humidity sensor |
